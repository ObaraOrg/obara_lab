## Vim has two modes of function

1. **Insert mode** (Where you can just type like normal text editor (press `i` for insert mode)
2. **Command mode**, where you give commands to the editor to get things done (press `ESC` for command mode)

**Most of the below commands are in command mode**

`:w` â€“ save changes<br>
`:q!` - to trash all changes<br>
`:wq` - to save and exit<br>
`x` - to delete the unwanted character<br>
`u` - to undo the last the command and U to undo the whole line<br>
`CTRL-R` to redo<br>
`A ` - to append text at the end<br>
`dw` - move the cursor to the beginning of the word to delete that word<br>
`2w` - to move the cursor two words forward<br>
`3e` - to move the cursor to the end of the third word forward<br>
`0 (zero)` - to move to the start of the line<br>

**The format for a change command is:  operator > number > motion**

 - `number` - is an optional count to repeat the motion
 - `operator` - is what to do, such as d for delete
 - `motion` - moves over the text to operate on, such as w (word), $ (to the end of line), etc**.
