## Running Serpent in hybrid mode

---

If you compiled Serpent with **OpenMP libraries** for parallel computing, you could run the input with multiple **OpenMP threads** to use more than one processor:
```sh
sss2 -omp N input
```
Where  **N**  is the number of **OpenMP threads** you want to use and can be set to, e.g. the number of available processor cores **(this just make threads on the cores of one processor, aka. only thread-based parallelism,**  **but without doing more than one MPI process per node**

`An example of the expected output is given below, although you should note that the statistical nature of the Monte Carlo methods means that you will not get exactly same values for the k-effective - UNCOMPLETE `

```sh
runmpi -np M sss2 input
```
This command executes the calculation in **M** hosts as defined in the parallel environment. Serpent uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI) [3] for parallel calculation. **(This one distributes threads to multiple hosts with multiple processors)**

To activate this capability the code must be compiled with the **PARALLEL_MPI** option (see the Makefile and additional docs with the Serpent scrips for details) and the MPI libraries must be installed on the system. There are two options for running the code in the parallel calculation mode. The first option is to use the standard MPI tools, such as mpirun.

The second option is to use the built-in MPI runner and define the number of tasks in the command line in this calculation mode, the code attempts to run mpirun on its own. This may require small modifications in the source code or may not work at all in some systems. The file path for mpirun is defined by the "MPIRUN_PATH" precompiler variable in the "header.h" source file.

**NOTE:** Check the script made for MPI/OMP hybrid script made for the TSUBAME inside the serpent install folder.

## Caution - MPI parallelization without MPI mode :

---

MPI scripts such as mpirun allow running Serpent even if the source code was not compiled in MPI mode. Instead of starting a single parallel simulation, the result is multiple independent simulations that read and write the same input and output files. If two or more writing operations happen to overlap, identical sections are repeated in the output files. If the tasks are sufficiently off-sync, the writing operations do not overlap, and it may actually seem like everything is OK - the correct number of CPU's are working, and the results look reasonable. The only thing that seems to be wrong is that the running time does not reflect the speed-up expected from the parallelization.

When MPI parallelization is executed correctly, the run-time output shows the number of mpi tasks, for example (MPI=10). The number of tasks is also printed in variable MPI\_TASKS in the main output file ([input]\_res.m). Whether the source code was compiled in MPI mode or not can be checked with sss2 -version.

## Important notes on parallel calculation :
taken from the 2015 manual
1. When multiple tasks are sharing the same memory space, the size of allocated memory is also multiplied. This should be considered when setting the memory size in the compilation.

## Scheduler

---

`qhost` - see the hosts avalabile for use (cluster)

`qsub` - use it for submitting scheduled jobs to the local cluster or the TSUBAME

**NOTE** - the qsub on the Tsubame needs to have the `-g tga-oba2` argument for specifing the work group, see more here -> [TSUBARE Job Scheduler](https://helpdesk.t3.gsic.titech.ac.jp/manuals/handbook.en/jobs/) and this [General qsub tutorial](https://bioinformatics.mdc-berlin.de/intro2UnixandSGE/sun_grid_engine_for_beginners/how_to_submit_a_job_using_qsub.html)

`qstat` - see the status of the job, as well as the job ID<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`â€“u "*" `- see job status for all users<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`-r` - Show job resources.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`-f` - Display queue status details.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`-j JOBID` - Displays job details for the specified job ID.<br>

`qdel` - schedule the the job for deletion, takes the job ID as an argument

`qmon` - Tool to operate GridEngine with her GUI of X-Window. (avalabile only via remote xrdp on the cluster)

## TSUBAME tips

---

The evironment on the Tsubame work by loading modules, here's an example of the ones needed to work serpent in MPI, OMPI mode 

```sh

# Its a usefull to commit these lines to you .bashrc

source /etc/profile.d/modules.csh
module load gcc
module load cuda
module load intel
module load openmpi
module load python/3.6.5
```
