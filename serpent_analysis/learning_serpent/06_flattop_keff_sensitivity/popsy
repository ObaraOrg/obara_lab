% The experimental configuration consists of a plutonium alloy sphere (radius 4.5332 cm) reflected 
% by a natural uranium blanket (outer radius 24.1420 cm). 
% The multiplication factor of the system is close to unity (being a critical experiment). 
% This input calculates the sensitivity of the multiplication factor to perturbations applied to the 
% cross sections of 235U, 238U, 239Pu and 240Pu. 
% A processing script for MATLAB/OCTAVE is provided for printing and plotting out the sensitivities.
