% --- FA Lattices definition 
%     Pin lattice definition, name of the lattice "LatFA"
%     Lattice type 3 (hex lattice)
%     Lattice centered at 0.0 0.0
%     11 x 11 lattice elements
%     Lattice pitch 1.9397
%     1/6 symmetry so that we'll only have to type
%     in 1/6h of the assembly (lazy to do it here)

% --- Apply a symmetry to the lattice "lat1"
%     Symmetry axis is the z-axis (3)
%     Symmetry boundary condition is reflective (2)
%     Symmetry axis is located at coordinates (0.0 0.0)
%     Symmetry covers an angle starting from 270 degrees and extending for 60 degrees
