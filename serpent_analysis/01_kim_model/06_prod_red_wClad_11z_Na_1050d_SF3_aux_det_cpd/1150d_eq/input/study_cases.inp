% NOTE: Variables are used to pass additional information to output:
%       LIB - Cross section library used in the calculation
%       VHI - coolant temperature during burnup calculation
%       TMO - coolant temperature at branch
%       TFU - fuel temperature at branch
%       CR  - insertion of control rods (0 = out, 1 = in)
